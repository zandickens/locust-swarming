# A server program which accepts requests from clients to capitalize strings. When
 # clients connect, a new thread is started to handle a client. The receiving of the
 # client data, the capitalizing, and the sending back of the data is handled on the
 # worker thread, allowing much greater throughput because more clients can be handled
 # concurrently.
